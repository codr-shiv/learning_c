# Learning C

This repository contains the collection of C programs I write as I practice the fundamentals of the C programming language.  
It includes examples, exercises, and small projects that cover syntax, problem-solving, and core concepts.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure
Each file corresponds to an individual program or concept

## ðŸš€ Getting Started
To compile and run any program:
```bash
gcc program_name.c -o test
./test.exe
